# QLMED agent instructions

## Sources of truth

- Delivery roadmap and execution state: `.planning/`
- Feature behavior and acceptance criteria: `specs/`
- Project principles: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- Current architecture: `docs/architecture/`
- Durable decisions: `docs/decisions/`
- Domain vocabulary and invariants: `docs/domain/`
- Database model and migrations: `prisma/schema.prisma` and `prisma/migrations/`
- Executable evidence: code, tests and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Do not copy the same requirement or decision into multiple sources. Link to the
canonical document instead.

## Required workflow

1. Read the relevant GSD phase and feature specification.
2. Read applicable architecture documents and accepted ADRs.
3. Resolve material ambiguity before implementation.
4. Add or update tests for behavioral changes.
5. Run checks proportional to the change.
6. Report checks actually run; never infer that a check passed.

## Validation commands

```bash
npm run docs:validate
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:integration
npm run build
```

Database changes additionally require:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:verify
npm run db:reconcile:verify
```

## Safety boundaries

- Never read, print, add or commit `.env` files or backups.
- QLMED has one persistent canonical PostgreSQL database (`postgres`) configured
  only through `DATABASE_URL`; do not create or expect a `qlmed_dev` database,
  arbitrary database name or parallel database URL aliases. CI may use its
  disposable `qlmed_ci` service. Local development against the canonical
  database is allowed only with protected credentials, background services
  disabled, and a current backup receipt.
- Do not run deploy, publish, migration deploy or production scripts unless the
  user explicitly requests that external effect.
- Schema changes use versioned Prisma migrations. Runtime DDL is legacy and
  must not be introduced.
- Preserve single-company isolation: derive company context from the
  authenticated user through the canonical helpers, not request-controlled IDs.
- Authorization is enforced server-side. UI visibility is not authorization.
- External integrations need bounded timeouts, safe logging and explicit error
  handling. Never log credentials, certificates, tokens or complete fiscal XML.
- An accepted ADR is historical. Supersede it with a new ADR instead of
  rewriting its outcome.

## Spec Kit and GSD

- GSD owns phases, execution state, summaries and continuity.
- Spec Kit owns the behavioral contract, technical feature plan and task
  traceability.
- Use a full specification for observable behavior, contracts, permissions,
  persistence, integrations or significant non-functional requirements.
- Use an ADR when a decision is durable, cross-feature or architecturally
  constraining. Keep local reversible choices in the feature plan.
